<b> Lab | <b> Bioinformatics and Computational Biology
<b> Experiment|     <b> To analyze the sequence of a given DNA and find out sequence composition

### About the Experiment 

The goal of proposed virtual laboratories is to achieve a conceptual understanding of standard protocols and tools in biotechnology and biomedical engineering at an advanced level that may be useful in interdisciplinary fields of science and technology.
  
With this experiment, the user can

  1. Analyze the general compositional features of a given DNA sequence.
  2. Quantitatively evaluate genome organization and biological functions of the genome in a broader sense
  3. Apply knowledge on sequence composition for molecular biology experiments
