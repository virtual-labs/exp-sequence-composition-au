3.	User can give the inputs for all the variable buttons DNA composition, Case Conversion, and Transformation. Then click on Finalize followed by submit button to display the result. 

&nbsp; 

4.	Brief explanation of each buttons in the simulator window is discussed below. 

&nbsp; 

5.	Click on “DNA Composition” button. It has specific drop down menu to find DNA sequence composition A, T, G, C, AT-count and GC-count. User can select(click) the composition of sequence to be calculated. If the user needs to calculate  detailed count of sequence composition select option “All”.

7.	The result will be displayed in the GUI. 
 
Result showed the AT content (%) and GC content (%) of the given sequence. Also the number of each base composition is displayed separately. The pie chart showed the percentage of each base composition in the given DNA sequence.
